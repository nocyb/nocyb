## 🌟 My Projects  

### [Minitalk](https://github.com/nocyb/MiniTalk)  
A project that implements inter-process communication using UNIX signals. It consists of a **server** that receives messages and a **client** that sends them. This project helped me deepen my understanding of signals and process management in C.  

### [Push_Swap](https://github.com/nocyb/Push_Swap)  
An algorithmic project that sorts a stack of integers using a limited set of operations. The goal is to find the most efficient sequence of operations to sort the stack. This project challenged me to optimize algorithms and improve my problem-solving skills.
